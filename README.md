No Losers… No Winners… No Winners without Losers… No Losers without Winners…

Programming is easier than language for humans.

Fairness is what you see. We never reach equality, but we can manage rules to make it fun for everyone.

Try to eliminate losers with the need of a _fail NFT to blend for higher tiers, as well as the opportunity to blend 3x for the same tier package, which 100% drops BL or 5x for the next tier. So you can sell them as they are needed for blends or hodl them for later use.

Roadmap Brake… Price may change…
