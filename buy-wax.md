### As always do your Own Research.!.!.

What is a crypto exchange?
A crypto exchange is a platform on which you can buy and sell cryptocurrency. You can use exchanges to trade one crypto for another â€” converting Bitcoin / Ethereum to WAX, for example. This is not recommended for new users.
Your account address is: Public.... And you have to keep the Private Key Private!!!

### Not your Key not your Tokens.!.!.

Danger on Exchange$

- You set a Price too Low and Lose Value
- You set a Price too High and Sell maybe in 10 Years (Might be your Plan)
- The exchange gets Hacked and the Hackers know your Account and can Do what they want
- The Exchange Runs away and you will never get your Tokens Back

But tomorrow, a big Comet could hit the Earth and so on... The exchanges on the List are from AtomicHub Recommended and have a long time running Business.

In the end, it's on you where you get your foot in. I'm happy to share for anyone new at Wax. Check out #bp0x0.
